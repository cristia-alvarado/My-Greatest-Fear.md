# **My Greatest Fear**
__By. Cristian Alvarado__

> Im Scared of Feeling Alone
* Being ignored, uncared for or feeling abandoned makes my soul feel shattered
* Feeling alone makes me have a feeling worse than sadness
* Feeling alone feels like a shadow is constantly looking at you.

> Feeling alone is like being in the darkness not being able to see anything
